        <div>
          <br></br>
          <pre> It is understood that users downloading the Maximum 1™ Life App agree that its use is at their own risk. The user acknowledges the Human Behavior Matrix™ (THE HB-X™) process used within the app involves unpredictable, potentially triggering, and in-depth emotional work and that it is the user’s responsibility to provide themselves with the appropriate support(s) (e.g. trusted and licensed mental health care professional) to maximize its use. The user also agrees that Marius Massie, Maximum 1™, or any of its subsidiaries, partners, or affiliates assume no liability for any psychological, physical, emotional, spiritual or otherwise harmful conditions or actions that might occur during or as a result of continuing use of the Maximum 1™ Life App.
          When you can clear the emotional damage of years of trauma in a few clicks, it’s time to listen. Don’t allow pain to dominate and continually hinder your relationships, productivity, or self-worth. Be free. Use the Maximum 1™ Life App featuring THE HB-X™ to get “unstuck” and reclaim your true self.
          Our Mission
          To propel personal security and emotional stability for high-performance living.
          Vision
          To see leaders emerge who advance change in their spheres of influence.
          “THE HB-X™ is a powerful protocol that initiates a journey of healing, directing you through prompts of self-reflection that uncover the roots of unwanted symptoms, behaviors and attitudes. It brings you from this personal insight to the imperative step of replacing the old information with evidence that is based on the truth. When these negative beliefs and distortions come into contact with the truth, it has the potential to bring about transformational change that is lasting.”

          <h1 className="tealText">Helpful Strategies</h1>
          <pre>Jesus makes the difference. Though you don’t have to be Christian to use our app, if you have a
          relationship with Jesus, healing is highly probable if you are praying through each step allowing
          the Holy Spirit to give you insight. Use the Resources we provide to find scriptures attacking
          wrongly held beliefs you have at the root.

          Take care of you. Throughout this process, you may feel anxious, stuck, or any number of uncomfortable or new feelings. This is normal. Use these emotions as signals to give yourself permission to step back, reset, and create some space (e.g. breaks, getting support, etc.), so you can resettle and when ready, continue.
            <li> <b> Take your time. </b> Your goal isn’t speed, but accuracy. </li>
            <li> <b>  Meditation is critical. </b> Learn how to quiet your mind so you can “hear” from your heart. This is heart-work, not head-work. This is, for each step, an exercise in discovery, not “figuring things out.” If you’re having difficulty, then working with a trusted and licensed mental health care professional may help. If you’re a person of faith, prayer is a valuable tool to quiet “noise” (i.e., anxiety, distractions, fear, etc.) so you can commune more effectively with your Higher Power and get guidance.
 </li>
            <li> <b> Some behaviors have many roots </b> Don’t be discouraged if after working through one trigger and “getting to the root” that some behaviors in your tree still exist. Especially with addiction, some behaviors are “tied” into many different emotional learnings. It may take time and working through many triggers to successfully “cut off” what sources are fueling certain behaviors. Don’t quit! You’ll feel, with each completed tree, such behaviors bit-by-bit losing control.
 </li>
            <li> <b> Get support. </b>  Before working through your tree, please find trusted and qualified allies to help keep your behaviors stable. You may have to uncover deep emotional wounds that are painful or sensitive in order to fully heal and recover your true self. It’s worth it! Imagine someone pushing down on an infected physical wound; it’ll cause us to sharply react. This reaction may include resorting to an old coping behavior that’s no longer helpful, or may even be harmful. Get help. Be accountable, and do your tree work in community.
 </li>
            <li> <b>Brutal honesty is needed for full recovery. </b>  It’ll be tempting to “sugar-coat” your data because it’s shocking or embarrassing. Avoid doing this. Yes, maybe use abbreviations or coded language to honor your personal values, but let it come out as “raw” as it really is, or you won’t be as successful finding patterns and the “truth” of your story. You could miss the root. You’ll still get better, but not heal.
 </li>
            <li> <b> Success is making this part of your daily lifestyle. </b> This isn’t a “one-and-done.” What we mean is disappointment, trauma (big “T,” little “t”), and discouragement don’t stop coming. Though we heal one wound, we can get one phone call that creates another. The good news now is you have a permanent tool to help heal and reclaim your true self. You have more power to keep your heart, mind, and life together even when things go wrong.
 </li>
